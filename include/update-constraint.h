/**
 * @file update-constraint.h
 *
 * A constraint to be applied to an update operation or the creation of an
 * update stream.
 *
 * Constraints describe a condition that must be satisfied for an operation to
 * succeed. Constraints can be applied to the setting of a value or creation
 * of an update stream. Constraints are only evaluated on the server.
 *
 * The constraints are evaluated using the:
 *
 * - active session locks
 * - existence of the topic
 * - current value of the topic
 *
 * The value of a topic can be described in several ways. The value can be
 * described as an exact value, a partial value or an unset value.
 *
 * Constraints can be composed with one another. It is only possible to
 * construct logical ANDs of constraints. Constraints can only be composed if
 * the resulting constraint is satisfiable. Multiple session locks can be held
 * but a topic can only have a single value. Constraints specifying multiple
 * topic values cannot be constructed.
