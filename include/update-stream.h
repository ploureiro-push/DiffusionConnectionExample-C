/**
 * @file update-stream.h
 *
 * An update stream provides a method for updating a specific topic.
 *
 * An update stream is associated with a specific topic. The type of the
 * topic must match the type of values passed to the update stream. It can
 * be created with an optional `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_UPDATE_CONSTRAINT_T`. The
 * existence of the topic, its type and the constraint are validated lazily
 * by the first `diffusion_topic_update_stream_set` or
 * `diffusion_topic_update_stream_validate` operation. Subsequent
 * operations issued before the first operation completes will be deferred
 * until the completion of the first operation.
 *
 * An update stream can be used to send any number of updates. It sends a
 * sequence of updates for a specific topic to the server. If supported by the
 * data type, updates will be sent to the server as a stream of binary deltas.
 * An update stream does not prevent other sessions from updating the topic. If
 * exclusive access is required update streams should be used with session locks
 * as constraints.
 *
 * Once validated an update stream can be invalidated. An invalidated
 * update stream rejects the operations applied to it. The update stream
 * will be invalidated if:
 *
 * - the topic is removed
 * - another update stream is created for the same topic
 * - the topic is updated to a new value by anything other than the stream
 * - the session does not have the `TOPIC_PERMISSION_UPDATE_TOPIC`
 * - an operation fails because of cluster repartitioning
 *
 * Update streams are thread-safe.
 *
 * Update streams are created using the topic-update feature.
