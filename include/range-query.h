 * `diffusion_time_series_range_query` returns a default range query. Further
 * queries with different parameters can be configured using the functions of
 * this header file. Function calls can be chained together in a fluent manner to
 * create a query. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // A value range query that selects up to 100 original events from the
 * // start of a time series.
 * DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_RANGE_QUERY_T *range_query = diffusion_time_series_range_query();
 * diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values(range_query, NULL);
 * diffusion_time_series_range_query_from_start(range_query, NULL);
 * diffusion_time_series_range_query_next(range_query, 100, NULL);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Creating value range queries</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A value range query returns a merged view of part of a time series. This
 * is the most common time series query and appropriate for most
 * applications.
 *
 * <p>
 * A value range query begins with the `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values`
 * operator, followed by the <em>view range</em>. The view range determines the range
 * of original events the time series that are of interest.
 * <p>
 * The events returned by the query are constrained by an optional <em>edit
 * range</em>, introduced by the `diffusion_time_series_range_query_edit_range`
 * operator. An event will only be included in the result if it is in the edit range.
 * Let's consider some examples to see how the view range and the edit range
 * interact.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Query</th>
 * <th>Meaning</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values(range_query, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>For each original event in the time series, either return the latest
 * edit event or if it has no edit events, return the original event.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values(range_query, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 100, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_to(range_query, 150, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>For each original event with a sequence number between 100 and 150
 * (inclusive), either return the latest edit event or if it has no edit
 * events, return the original event.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values(range_query, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 100, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_to(range_query, 150, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_edit_range(range_query, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 400, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>For each original event with a sequence number between 100 and 150
 * (inclusive), return the latest edit event with a sequence number greater
 * than or equal to 400.
 * <p>
 * The result of this query will not include any original events because
 * there is no overlap between the view range and the edit range.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * Value range queries can be further refined using the
 * `diffusion_time_series_range_query_limit` and `diffusion_time_series_range_query_as`
 * operators.
 *
 * <h2>Creating edit range queries</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * An edit range query returns an unmerged view of a time series than can
 * include both original events and the edit events that replace them. Edit
 * range queries are rarely needed &ndash; value range queries satisfy most
 * use cases.
 *
 * <p>
 * An edit range query begins with the `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits`
 * operator, followed by the <em>view range</em>. The view range determines the range
 * of original events the time series that are of interest. The result will
 * only contain original events that are in the view range, and edit events
 * for original events in the view range.
 * <p>
 * The events returned by the query are constrained by an optional <em>edit
 * range</em>, introduced by the `diffusion_time_series_range_query_latest_edits` or
 * `diffusion_time_series_range_query_all_edits` operators. An event will only be
 * included in the result if it is in the edit range. Let's consider some example
 * edit range queries.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Query</th>
 * <th>Meaning</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits(range_query, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>Return all events in a time series.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits(range_query, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 100, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_to(range_query, 150, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>Return the original events with a sequence number between 100 and 150
 * (inclusive) and all edit events in the time series that refer to the
 * original events.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits(range_query, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 100, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_to(range_query, 150, NULL);
 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_latest_edits(range_query, NULL);}</td>
 * <td>Return the original events with a sequence number between 100 and 150
 * (inclusive) and the latest edit events in the time series that refer to
 * the original events.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits(range_query, NULL);

 *  diffusion_time_series_range_query_from(range_query, 400, NULL);}
 * </td>
 * <td>For each original event with a sequence number between 100 and 150,
 * (inclusive) return all edit events with a sequence number greater than or
 * equal to 400.
 * <p>
 * The result of this query will not include any original events because
 * there is no overlap between the view range and the edit range.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * Edit range queries can be further refined using the `diffusion_time_series_range_query_limit`
 * and `diffusion_time_series_range_query_as` operators.
 *
 * <h2>Range expressions</h2>
 * <p>
 * Range expressions are used to specify the view and edit ranges in value
 * range and edit range queries. Each range expression has an
 * <em>anchor</em> that determines where to start, and a <em>span</em> that
 * determines where the range ends. Both anchor and span are
 * <em>inclusive</em> &ndash; if an anchor or span falls on an event, the
 * event is included in the result.
 *
 * Both anchor and the span are optional. If the anchor is unspecified, the
 * range begins at the start of the time series. If the span is unspecified,
 * the range continues until the end of the time series.
 *
 * <h3>Anchors</h3>
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Anchor</th>
 * <th>Meaning</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_from}</td>
 * <td>Sets the anchor at an absolute sequence number.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_from_start}</td>
 * <td>Sets the anchor at the start of the time series.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>

 * <td>Sets the anchor at an absolute time.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_from_last}</td>
 * <td>Sets the anchor at a relative offset before the end of the time
 * series. For value range queries, `count` is the number of original
 * events. For edit range queries, `count` is the number of events of
 * any type.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_from_last_millis}</td>
 * <td>Sets the anchor at a relative time before the timestamp of the last
 * event of the time series.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * An anchor point can be before the start or after the end of the time
 * series.
 *
 * <h3>Spans</h3>
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Span</th>
 * <th>Meaning</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_to}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an absolute sequence number. The `sequence`
 * argument may be before or after the anchor.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_to_start}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at the start of the time series.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_to_time}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an absolute time. The `instant` argument may
 * be before or after the anchor.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_next}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative number of events after
 * the anchor. For value range queries, `count` is the number of
 * original events. For edit range queries, `count` is the number of
 * events of any type.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_next_millis}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative time after the
 * anchor.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_previous}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative number of events before
 * the anchor. For value range queries, `count` is the number of
 * original events. For edit range queries, `count` is the number of
 * events of any type.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_previous_millis}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative time before the
 * anchor.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_until_last}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative number of events before
 * the end of the time series. For value range queries, `count` is the
 * number of original events. For edit range queries, `count` is the
 * number of events of any type.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code diffusion_time_series_range_query_until_last_millis}</td>
 * <td>The range ends at an event that is a relative time before the
 * timestamp of the last event of the time series.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * A span can specify an end point that is before the start or after the end
 * of the time series.
 * <p>
 * If the span specifies an end point after the anchor, the range includes
 * the first event at or following the anchor and ends at the last event at
 * or preceding the end point. If the span specifies an end point before the
 * anchor, the range includes the first event at or preceding the anchor and
 * ends at the last event at or after the end point.
 *
 * <h2>Using the builder functions</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the natural order of operators in a query is as shown in the
 * syntax diagrams above, range query builder functions &ndash; those that
 * return another range query &ndash; can be applied in any order with the
 * following exceptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>`diffusion_time_series_range_query_edit_range` only applies to value
 * range queries, so cannot follow `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits`
 * without an intervening `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values`;
 * <li>`diffusion_time_series_range_query_latest_edits` and
 * `diffusion_time_series_range_query_all_edits` only apply to edit range queries,
 * so cannot follow `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values` without
 * an intervening `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits`.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each function overrides some configuration of the range query to which it is
 * applied, as summarized in the following table.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Builder function</th>
 * <th>Operator type</th>
 * <th>Overridden configuration</th>
