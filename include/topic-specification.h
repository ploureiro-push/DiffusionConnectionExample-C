/**
 * Key of the topic property that specifies a removal policy for automatic
 * removal of the topic (and/or other topics).
 *
 * This property is specified as an expression which defines one or more
 * conditions that are to be satisfied before automatic removal occurs.
 * The expression takes the form:-
 *
 * <code>when 'conditions' remove 'selector'</code>
 *
 * At least one condition must be supplied. If more than one is supplied,
 * they must be separated by logical operators 'and' or 'or'.
 * The natural evaluation order of the operators may be changed by
 * surrounding with parentheses
 *
 * The 'remove' clause is optional. It provides a
 * topic selector expression representing the topics to be removed.
 * If a 'remove' clause is specified, the topic with the removal
 * policy will only be removed if its path matches the selector expression.
 * The selector must be surrounded by either double or single quotes.
 *
 * The permissions that are applied at the time of removal are those defined
 * by the roles of the principal that created the topic at the time of
 * creation. The roles of that principal may therefore change before the
 * removal with no effect, but if the permissions given to the roles change
 * it may have an effect upon the final removal.
 *
 * Only one occurrence of each of the following 4 condition types may be
 * included within the expression:-
 *
 * 1) `time after <absoluteTime>`

 * Removal should occur after a specified absolute time. The <absoluteTime>
 * may be specified as as a number of milliseconds since the epoch (00:00:00
 * on 1 January 1970) or as a quoted date and time formatted in RFC_1123 date
 * time format. Either single or double quotes may be used.
 *
 * 2) `subscriptions < n for <period> [after <period>]`

 * Removal should occur when the topic has had less than the specified
 * number (n) of subscriptions for a given period of time. Optionally, an
 * 'after' period may be specified by which to delay the initial checking of
 * this condition. See below for period formats.
 *
 * 3) `no updates for <period> [after <period>]`
 *
 * Removal should occur when the topic has had no updates for a given period
 * of time. Optionally, an 'after' period may be specified by which to delay
 * the initial checking of this condition. See below for period formats.
 *
 * 4) `no session has "criteria" [for <period>] [after <period>]`
 *
 * Removal should occur when there are no sessions satisfying certain
 * criteria. Optionally, the criteria can be required to be satisfied 'for' a
 * period of time. Optionally, an 'after' period can be specified to delay the
 * initial check of the criteria.
 *
 * Session selection criteria are specified as defined for session filters and
 * must be surrounded by single or double quotes. See below for period formats.
 * A shorthand form of this is 'this session closes' which may be used to
 * indicate that the topic is to be removed when the session that created it
 * closes.
 *
 * Time periods are specified as a number followed (with no intermediate space)
 * by a single letter representing the time unit. The time unit may be 's'
 * (seconds), 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours) or 'd' (days). For example 10 minutes
 * would be specified as 10m.
 *
 * If quotes or backslashes (\) are required within quoted values such as
 * selectors or session criteria then they may be escaped by preceding with \.
 *
 * The expression is validated only by the server and therefore if an invalid
 * expression is specified it will be reported as an invalid topic specification
 * error when creating the topic.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * `when time after 1518780068112`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the date and time indicated by the
 * specified number of milliseconds since the epoch has passed.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT"`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" remove "*alpha/beta//"`
 *
 * The topic alpha/beta and all topics subordinate to it will be removed
 * when the specified date and time has passed.
 *
 * `when subscriptions < 1 for 20m`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when it has had no subscriptions for a
 * continuous period of 20 minutes.
 *
 * `when subscriptions < 2 for 20m after 1h`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when it has had less than 2 subscriptions for a
 * continuous period of 20 minutes after one hour has passed since its
 * creation.
 *
 * `when no updates for 3h`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when it has had no updates for a continuous
 * period of 3 hours.
 *
 * `when no updates for 15m after 1d`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when it has had no updates for a continuous
 * period of 15 minutes after one day has passed since its creation.
 *
 * `when this session closes`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the session that created it is closed.
 *
 * <code>when no session has "$Principal is 'Alice'"</code>
 *
 * The topic will be removed when there have been no sessions with the
 * principal 'Alice' for a continuous period of 10 minutes.
 *
 * <code>when no session has "$Principal is 'Alice'" for 10m</code>
 *
 * The topic will be removed when there have been no sessions with the
 * principal 'Alice' for a continuous period of 10 minutes.
 *
 * <code>when no session has 'Department is "Accounts"' for 30m after 2h</code>
 *
 * The topic will be removed when there have been no sessions from the
 * Accounts department for a continuous period of 30 minutes after 2 hours
 * have passed since its creation.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" and subscriptions < 1 for 30m`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed and
 * the topic has had no subscriptions for a continuous period of 30 minutes
 * after that time.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" and subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed and
 * the topic has had less than 2 subscriptions for a continuous period of 10
 * minutes after that time plus one hour.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" or subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed or
 * the topic has had less than 2 subscriptions for a continuous period of 10
 * minutes after one hour from its creation.
 *
 * `when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" and (subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h or no updates for 20m)`
 *
 * The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed and
 * either the topic has had less than 2 subscriptions for a continuous
 * period of 10 minutes after that time plus one hour or it has had no
 * updates for a continuous period of 20 minutes. Note that the parentheses
 * are significant here as without them the topic would be removed if it had
 * had no updates for 20 minutes regardless of the time and subscriptions
 * clause.
 *
 * Notes and restrictions on use:
 *
 * The '`after`' time periods refer to the period since the topic was created or
 * restored from persistence store after a server is restarted. They are designed
 * as a 'grace' period after the topic comes into existence before the related
 * condition starts to be evaluated. When not specified the conditions start to be
 * evaluated as soon as the topic is created or restored.
 *
 * The server will evaluate conditions on a periodic basis (every few seconds) so
 * the exact removal time will not be precise for low periodic granularity.
 *
 * The meaning of the '`for`' period on '`no session has`' conditions is subtly
 * different from on other conditions. It does not guarantee that there has been
 * no session satisfying the condition at some point between evaluations, only that
 * when evaluated the given period of time has passed since it was last evaluated
 * and found to have no matching sessions.
 *
 * Subscriptions is the number of subscriptions to a topic, including those that
 * occur through routing or slave topics.
 *
 * Automatic topic removal is supported for both replicated topics and topics
 * fanned out to secondary servers using the fan-out feature. A 'subscriptions
 * less than' condition for such topics will be evaluated against the total number
 * of subscriptions to the topic across the cluster and on all downstream secondary
 * servers. A 'no session has' condition will consider all sessions hosted across a
 * cluster and hosted by downstream secondary servers.

/**
 * Key of the topic property that describes the conflation policy of the
 * topic. The policy specifies how the server manages queued topic updates.
 * Conflation is applied individually to each session queue.
 *
 * Conflation is the process of merging or discarding topic updates queued
 * for a session to reduce the server memory footprint and network data. The
 * server will conflate sessions that have a large number of queued messages
 * to meet configured queue size targets. The sessions with the largest
 * queues are typically slow consumers or have been disconnected â both will
 * benefit from conflation. This property allows conflation behaviour to be
 * tuned on a topic-by-topic basis.
 *
 * Supported policies are:
 *
 * - `off`
 * - `conflate`
 * - `unsubscribe`
 * - `always`
 *
 * The default policy used when the property is not specified and the topic
 * type is not time series is `conflate`. The default policy used when the
 * property is not specified and the topic type is time series is `off`.
 *
 * The policy `off` disables conflation for the topic. This policy disables
 * all conflation for the topic, so topic updates will never be merged or
 * discarded.
 *
 * The policy `conflate` automatically conflates topic updates when back
 * pressure is detected by the server. This policy is ignored for stateless,
 * single value and record topics, and for slave and routing topics that
 * reference stateless, single value and record topics.
 *
 * The policy `unsubscribe` automatically unsubscribes the topic when back
 * pressure is detected by the server. The unsubscription is not persisted
 * to the cluster, if a session fails over to a different server it will be
 * resubscribed to the topic.
 *
 * The policy `always` automatically conflates topic updates as they are
 * queued for the session. This is an eager policy that ensures only the
 * latest update is queued for the topic, minimising the server memory and
 * network bandwidth used by the session. This policy is ignored for
 * stateless, single value and record topics, and for slave and routing
 * topics that reference stateless, single value and record topics.
 *
 * The `conflate` and `unsubscribe` policies are applied when the server
 * detects back pressure for a session. The server configuration places
 * limits on the data queued for each session. If these limits are breached,
 * the server will conflate the session queue to attempt to reduce its size.
 * If the session queue still exceeds the limits after conflation, the
 * session will be terminated.
 *
 * Conflation of stateless, single value and record topics is configured
 * using server-side configuration. This configuration describes how topic
 * updates should be merged. Like the `always` policy conflation specified
 * this way is applied when queuing a topic update. The policy `off`
 * prevents this conflation being applied. All other policies allow
 * conflation specified this way to happen. The `unsubscribe` policy will
 * still unsubscribe topics that use conflation specified this way.
 *
 * The policies `conflate` and `always` are not supported for
 * time series topics as they would cause missing events. Attempts to enable
 * these policies with time series topics will cause the creation of the
 * topic to fail, reporting that the specification is invalid.

/**
 * Key of the topic property that allows the compression policy to be set
 * on a per-topic basis.
 *
 * Compression reduces the bandwidth required to broadcast topic updates to
 * subscribed sessions, at the cost of increased server CPU.
 *
 * Changes to a topic's value are published to each subscribed session as a
 * sequence of topic messages. A topic message can carry the latest value or
 * the difference between the latest value and the previous value (a delta).
 * The compression policy determines if and how published topic messages
 * are compressed. Topic messages are not exposed through the client API;
 * the client library handles decompression and decodes deltas
 * automatically, passing reconstructed values to the application.
 *
 * The compression policy for a topic is specified by setting this property
 * to one of several values:
 *
 * - `off`
 * - `low`
 * - `medium`
 * - `high`
 *
 * The policies are listed in the order of increasing compression and
 * increasing CPU cost. `off` disables compression completely for the
 * topic and requires no additional CPU; `high` compresses the topic
 * messages to the smallest number of bytes, but has the highest CPU cost.
 * Generally some compression is beneficial, so the default value for this
 * property is `low`.
 *
 * Prior to version 6.4, only two values were allowed: `true`
 * (equivalent to `medium`, and the previous default policy) and
 * `false` (equivalent to `off`). These values are still
 * supported.
 *
 * This property is only one factor that determines whether a topic message
 * will be compressed. Other factors include:
 *
 * - Compression must be enabled in the server configuration.
 *
 * - The client library must support the server's compression
 *   scheme. In this release, the server supports zlib
 *   compression, and also allows compression to be disabled on a
 *   per-connector basis. From 6.4, all client libraries are
 *   capable of zlib compression. A JavaScript client may or may
 *   not support zlib compression, depending on whether the zlib
 *   library can be loaded. The zlib library is packaged
 *   separately to reduce the download size of the core library.
