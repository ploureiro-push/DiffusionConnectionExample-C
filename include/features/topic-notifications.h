/**
 * @file topic-notifications.h
 *
 * This feature allows a client session to receive notifications about changes
 * to selected topics.
 *
 * Sessions receive notifications via `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T`s
 * The listener will be provided with the topic specifications for all topics
 * bound to paths that match registered selectors, and any subsequent notifications
 * for the selected topics on those paths, via
 * `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T.on_topic_notification`.
 * Notifications will only be emitted for paths where a topic is bound.
 *
 * For example, with a registered selector `"?a//"`, if a topic is added
 * at path `a/b/c/d` with no topics bound to paths higher in the hierarchy
 * `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T.on_topic_notification` will be called
 * once with a topic path of `"a/b/c/d"`, a notification type of `TOPIC_ADDED`, and
 * the topic's associated topic specification.
 *
 * The nature of the notification is provided by the`DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_T`
 * enum. `TOPIC_ADDED` and `TOPIC_REMOVED` represent structural changes to the topic tree;
 * `TOPIC_SELECTED` indicates that a pre-existing topic has been selected by a new
 * registered selector, and similarly `TOPIC_DESELECTED` indicates that a topic is no
 * longer selected because of changes to the set of registered selectors for the listener.
 *
 * Registered `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T`s  will receive notifications
 * for all topics matching registered selections. Selection of topics using
 * topic selector expressions is provided via the
 * `DIFFUSION_REGISTRATION_T` associated for a specific listener.
 *
 * A session can request selections at any time, even if the topics do not exist
 * at the server. Selections are stored on the server and any subsequently added
 * topics that match registered selectors will generate notifications.
 *
 * Listeners will be informed about the presence or absence of unselected immediate
 * descendants via `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T.on_descendant_notification`.
 * This allows listeners to determine whether to select deeper topic paths
 * in order to walk the topic tree. An immediate descendant is defined as the first
 * bound topic on any branch below a given topic path.
 *
 * For example, for topics at `"a/b", "a/c", "a/c/d", "a/e/f/g"`, the
 * immediate descendants of `"a"` would be `"a/b", "a/c", "a/e/f/g"`.
 *
 * Immediate descendant notifications provide a `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_T` to
 * indicate the reason for the notification in the same manner as
 * `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T.on_topic_notification`
 *
 * For example, with a registered selector `">a"`, if a topic is added at
 * path `a/b` then `DIFFUSION_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_T.on_descendant_notification`
 * will be called with a topic path of `"a/b"` and a notification type of
 * `TOPIC_ADDED`. If a topic was subsequently added at path `a/b/c`, no further
 * notifications will be received until `diffusion_topic_notification_registration_select`
 * was used to select the deeper topic path `">a/b"`.
 *
 * A listener will only be notified about topics for which the session
 * has `TOPIC_PERMISSION_SELECT_TOPIC` and `TOPIC_PERMISSION_READ_TOPIC` permissions.
 * `TOPIC_PERMISSION_SELECT_TOPIC` determines which selectors a listener may register;
 * `TOPIC_PERMISSION_READ_TOPIC` determines which selected topics the client may receive
 * notifications for.
