 *
 * This feature allows a session to update and query time series topics.
 *
 * <h2>Time series topics</h2>
 *
 * A time series is a sequence of events. Each event contains a value
 * and has server-assigned metadata comprised of a sequence number, timestamp,
 * and author. Events in a time series are ordered by increasing sequence
 * number. Sequence numbers have values between `0` and
 * `LONG_MAX` and are contiguous: an event with sequence number
 * `n` will be followed by one with sequence number `n + 1`. Two
 * events with the same sequence number will be equal; having the same
 * timestamp, author, and value.
 *
 * A time series topic allows sessions to access a time series that is
 * maintained by the server. A time series topic has an associated
 * event data type, such as `Binary`, `String`, or `JSON`, that determines
 * the type of value associated with each event.
 *
 * This feature provides a historic query API for time series topics, allowing a
 * session to query arbitrary sub-sequences of a time series. The
 * topic-control and topics features complete the API, providing
 * ways to create and subscribe to a time series topic.
 *
 * The API presents a time series as an append-only data structure of immutable
 * events that is only changed by adding new events.
 *
 * <h2>Edit events</h2>
 *
 * Although a time series is append-only, an event can be overridden by
 * appending an edit event. An edit event is a special type of event
 * that overrides an earlier event in the time series (referred to as the
 * original event) with a new value. When an edit event is added to a
 * time series, the server retains both the original event and the edit event,
 * allowing subscription and query results to reflect the edit.
 *
 * For example, suppose a time series has two events with the values `A`
 * and `B`, and the first event has been overridden by a later edit event
 * that provides a new value of `X`. The server has the following
 * information about the time series.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Sequence</th>
 * <th>Value</th>
 * <th>Type</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>0</td>
 * <td>A</td>
 * <td><em>original event</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>1</td>
 * <td>B</td>
 * <td><em>original event</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>X</td>
 * <td><em>edit of sequence 0</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * The current value of the event with sequence number 0 is `X`.
 *
 * If an original event has several edit events, the latest edit event (the one
 * with the highest sequence number) determines its current value. Each edit
 * event refers to an original event, never to another edit event.
 *
 * Extending the example by appending a further edit event to the time series:
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Sequence</th>
 * <th>Value</th>
 * <th>Type</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Y</td>
 * <td><em>second edit of sequence 0</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * The current value of the event with sequence number 0 is now `Y`.
 *
 * <h2>Retained range</h2>
 *
 * A time series topic retains a range of the most recent events. When a new
 * event is added to the time series, older events that fall outside of the
 * range are discarded. By default, this range includes the ten most recent
 * events. A different range can be configured by setting the
 * `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_RETAINED_RANGE` property.
 *
 * <h2>Subscribing to a time series topic</h2>
 *
 * A session can subscribe to a time series topic and add a value stream to
 * receive updates about events appended to the time series. Events are
 * represented by `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_EVENT_T` instances. Each event has a
 * value and `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_EVENT_METADATA_T`. An edit event has two sets of
 * metadata; its own metadata and that of the original event that it
 * replaces.
 *
 * <h2>Subscription range</h2>
 *
 * New subscribers are sent a range of events from the end of the time series.
 * This is known as the subscription range. Configuring a subscription
 * range is a convenient way to provide new subscribers with an appropriate
 * subset of the latest events.
 *
 * The default subscription range depends on whether the topic is configured to
 * publish delta streams. If delta streams are enabled, new subscribers are sent
 * the latest event if one exists. If delta streams are disabled, new
 * subscribers are sent no events. Delta streams are enabled by default and can
 * be disabled by setting the `DIFFUSION_PUBLISH_VALUES_ONLY` property to "true".
 *
 * A larger subscription range can be configured by setting the
 * `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_SUBSCRIPTION_RANGE` property. Regardless of the
 * `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_SUBSCRIPTION_RANGE` property, if delta streams are
 * enabled, new subscribers will be sent at least the latest event if one
 * exists.
 *
 * If the range of events is insufficient, the subscribing session can use a
 * range query to retrieve older events.
 *
 * When configuring a non-default subscription range for a time series topic,
 * register value streams before subscribing to the topic. The session only
 * maintains a local cache of the latest value received for a topic, not the
 * full subscription range. If a value stream is added after a session has
 * subscribed to a matching time series topic, the new stream will only be
 * notified of the latest value.
 *
 * <h2>Updating a time series topic</h2>
 *
 * A session can use `diffusion_time_series_append` to submit a value to be added to a
 * time series. The server will add an event to the end of the time series based
 * on the supplied value, with a new sequence number, timestamp, and the author
 * set to the authenticated principal of the session.
 *
 * A session can use `diffusion_time_series_edit` to submit an edit to an original time
 * series event, identified by its sequence number. The server will add an edit
 * event to the end of the time series based on the supplied value, with a new
 * sequence number, timestamp, and the author set to the authenticated principal
 * of the session.
 *
 * <h2>Querying a time series topic</h2>
 *
 * A range quert is a configured query that can be evaluated for a time series
 * topic using `diffusion_time_series_select_from`. Results are
 * provided as streams of `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_EVENT_T` instances.
 *
 * `DIFFUSION_TIME_SERIES_RANGE_QUERY_T` is a builder for configuring a Query that
 * selects a range of a time series. There are two types of range query that differ
 * in how edits are processed; value range queries and edit range queries.
 *
 * <h2>Value range queries</h2>
 *
 * A value range query returns a merged view of part of a time series. This is
 * the most common time series query and appropriate for most applications.
 *
 * The result of a value range query reflects the latest available edits and the
 * query result list is ordered by the original event sequence number, presenting
 * edit events instead of the original events they replace. Original events that
 * have no edit events are included verbatim. Original events that have edit events
 * are replaced by the latest edit event.
 *
 * A value range query of the example time series, with no range constraints so
 * the entire time series is selected, returns two events:
 *
 * <pre>
 * sequence=3, value=Y; original event sequence=0
 * sequence=1, value=B
 * </pre>
 *
 * The original value of the first event is not provided. It's apparent that the
 * first event is an edit event because it provides the metadata of the original
 * event it replaces.
 *
 * <h2>Edit range queries</h2>
 *
 * Applications with auditing and other administrative requirements can access
 * original event values using an edit range query. An edit range query returns
 * an unmerged view of a time series that can include both original events and
 * the edit events that replace them. Edit range queries are rarely needed
 * &ndash; value range queries satisfy most use cases.
 *
 * Edit range queries provide a detailed view of a time series. Because this is
 * potentially sensitive information, an edit range query can only be performed
 * by a session that has the `QUERY_OBSOLETE_TIME_SERIES_EVENTS` permission for
 * the target topic.
 *
 * There are two sub-types of edit range query.
 *
 * A full audit trail of edit events can be obtained using an all edits
 * edit range query. The result contains all original events selected by the
 * query, together with all subsequent edit events that affect the original
 * events. The query result stream provides events in time series order. An all
 * edits query of the example time series, with no range constraints so the
 * entire time series is selected, returns four events:
 *
 * <pre>
 * sequence=0; value=A
 * sequence=1; value=B
 * sequence=2; value=X; original event sequence=0
 * sequence=3; value=Y; original event sequence=0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A latest edits edit range query returns a query result stream in
 * time series order that contains all original events selected by the query,
 * together with the latest edit events that affect the original events. A
 * latest edits query of the example time series, with no range constraints so
 * the entire time series is selected, returns three events:
 *
 * <pre>
 * sequence=0; value=A
 * sequence=1; value=B
 * sequence=3; value=Y; original event sequence=0
 * </pre>
 *
 * The initial range of events delivered for a subscription to a time series
 * topic is derived from a latest edits edit range query. See
 * Subscription Range.
 *
 * When evaluated for a time series that has no edit events, an edit range query
 * will return the same results as a similarly configured value range query.
 *
 * <h2>Changes to a time series made outside the API</h2>
 *
 * The API presents a time series as an append-only data structure of immutable
 * events that is only changed by adding new events. The API does not allow
 * events to be deleted or edited.
 *
 * There are circumstances in which events can be removed from a time series by
 * server operations outside the API. For example, a time series topic can be
 * configured to discard or archive older events to save storage space; or the
 * time series may be held in memory and lost if the server restarts. Subscribed
 * sessions are not notified when events are removed in this way, but a session
 * can infer the removal of events that are no longer included in query results.
 * Similarly, an event's value can be changed on the server. For example, if an
 * administrator changes its value to redact sensitive data. Again, subscribed
 * sessions are not notified when events are modified, but a session can infer
 * this has happened from query results.
 *
 * Whether such changes can happen for a particular time series topic depends on
 * the topic specification, and the administrative actions that are allowed. To
 * write a robust application, do not rely on two Event instances with the same
 * sequence number but obtained though different API calls, being equal; nor
 * that there are no sequence number gaps between events in query results.
 *
 * <h2>Access control</h2>
 *
 * The session must have the `READ_TOPIC` topic permission for a topic to query a
 * time series topic. The `QUERY_OBSOLETE_TIME_SERIES_EVENTS` topic permission is
 * additionally required to evaluate an `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_edits`
 * query, or a `diffusion_time_series_range_query_for_values` with a
 * `diffusion_time_series_range_query_edit_range`.
 *
 * The session must have the `UPDATE_TOPIC` topic permission for a
 * topic to append a new event to a time series topic. The `EDIT_TIME_SERIES_EVENTS`
 * topic permission is additionally required to submit an edit to any time series
 * topic event. The more restrictive `EDIT_OWN_TIME_SERIES_EVENTS`
 * topic permission allows a session to submit edits to time series topic
 * events that are authored by the principal of the calling session.
