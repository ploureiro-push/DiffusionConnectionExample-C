/**

 *
 * Functions used for working with topic details (TOPIC_DETAILS_T).
 * Topic details describe the structure of a topic.
 *
 * If you intend to create many topics which have the same type of
 * topic details, e.g. single value string topics, then it is
 * recommended that you only create a single instance of topic details
 * to describe them. This will allow the server to cache the details,
 * significantly improving performance and reducing memory load.
