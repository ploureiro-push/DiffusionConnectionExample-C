 * when the session loses its connection to the server.
 *
 * To allow fine-grained access control, lock names are interpreted as path
 * names, controlled with the `ACQUIRE_LOCK` topic permission. This allows
 * permission to be granted to a session to acquire the lock `update-topic/a`
 * while preventing the session from acquiring the lock `update-topic/b`, for example.
