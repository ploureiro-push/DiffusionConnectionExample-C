/**
 * @deprecated This function is deprecated from version 6.1 onwards, and may

 *
 * @brief Convert binary (CBOR) data to a JSON string.
 *
 * This function is useful for converting data received on a JSON topic from
 * CBOR representation to a JSON string suitable for passing to a 3rd party
 * JSON parser.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Note that this is introducing an extra step (i.e., CBOR -> string -> JSON)
 * and if possible, you should read the CBOR tokens and convert them directly
 * to JSON representation using facilities provided by your JSON library.
 *
 * @param cbor A pointer to memory containing CBOR-encoded data.
 * @param len  The length of the CBOR-encoded data.
 * @returns A pointer to a BUF_T containing a JSON string, or NULL on error.
